## Graded Problem Set 5
##### Joshua Chen


### Stock Market Investment Decisions

##### Question 1

As seen in the graphs below, only stock X shows oscillatory behavior. However, stock X's oscilatory behavior is finite as it converges.
```{r, out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/joshuachen/pset5_modeling/stockx.png")
```
```{r, out.width = "350px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/joshuachen/pset5_modeling/stocky.png")
```

##### Question 2

For stock X, the graph below show the $f(x) = \cfrac{10x}{1+x^2}$ and $g(x) = x$

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/joshuachen/pset5_modeling/xbrouwer.png")
```

They clearly converge at $x = 3$ and this can easily be verifies.
$f(3) = \cfrac{10(3)}{1+3^2} = \cfrac{30}{10} = 3$ and $g(3) = 3$

For stock Y, the graph below show the $f(y) = \cfrac{10y^2}{1+y^2}$ and $g(y) = y$

```{r, out.width = "450px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/joshuachen/pset5_modeling/ybrouwer.png")
```

To find the point of intersection:

$\cfrac{10(y^2)}{1+y^2}-y = 0 \Rightarrow \cfrac{10(y^2)}{1+y^2} = y \Rightarrow {10(y)}{1+y^2} = 1 \Rightarrow 10y = 1+y^2 \Rightarrow y^2 - 10 y +1 = 0$

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- -10
c <- 1
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a * c))/(2*a)
```

Looking at the data:
```{r}
data <- read.csv("stock_data.csv")
data[69,"x"]
data[7,"y"]
```

By Brouwer's Theorem, we can conclude that stock X converges to 3, starting from $t = 69$ and stock Y converges to $9.898979$ starting from $t=7$

##### Question 3:
Over time, Y is the better better stock as stock Y converges to a higher price than stock X thought they start at the same price.
